There are many meditation techniques whose common purpose is to get peace of mind and get yourself relaxed.
When meditating, we have to focus on one place in our nose's tip where inhaling and outhaling air can be aware of. In that case, we just have to breath normallay with no effort exerted. 
However, before that, we'd better sit with cross-legged position in a relaxed way. We don't have to erect our back too much or incline forward - just a normal sitting position is ok.
And I would like to introduce a counting technique that I have learnt in that we have to count 1 to 8 while exhaling.
While focusing on the tip of our nose where the inhaling and exhaling air touch, we have to count in mind such that
inhale, exhale (1) (counting in mind while exhaling)
inhale, exhale (2) (counting in mind while exhaling)
inhale, exhale (3) (counting in mind while exhaling)
inhale, exhale (4) (counting in mind while exhaling)
inhale, exhale (5) (counting in mind while exhaling)
inhavle, exhale (6) (counting in mind while exhaling)
inhale, exhale (7) (counting in mind while exhaling)
inhale, exhale (8) (counting in mind while exhaling)
